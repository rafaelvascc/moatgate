# Moatgate - a user interface for identity Server

I created this project because i wanted to learn two things, Identity Server 4 and ASP.NET core Razor pages.

I know things are not optimal int the code, i jusnt wanted to make somthing that just worked while i learned to implement a proper security solution on a project i was working on.


I will restart to work on this project sometime in the near future. For now, fell free to clone, use and refactor this project as you wish if you need identity serve with a user interface.
