# Moatgate - a user interface for identity Server

I created this project because i wanted to learn two things, Identity Server 4 and ASP.NET Core Razor pages.

I know things are not optimal in the code, i just wanted to make something that "just works" while i learned to implement a proper security solution on a project i was working on.

I will restart to work on this project sometime in the near future. For now, fell free to clone, use and refactor it as you wish if you need an Identity Server with a user interface.

A UI using React and MaterialUI is on future plans.
